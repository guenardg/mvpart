##    Previous versions:
##    rpart by Terry M Therneau and Beth Atkinson <atkinson@mayo.edu>,
##    R port of rpart by Brian Ripley <ripley@stats.ox.ac.uk>,
##    Some routines added from vegan by Jari Oksanen <jari.oksanen@oulu.fi>,
##    Extensions and adaptations of rpart to mvpart by Glenn De'ath
##    <g.death@aims.gov.au>
##    Because the current version of rpart by cannot fit a multivariate
##    regression tree, this package has a function called rpartmv that is a
##    clone of a previous version of rpart which has been adapted by G. De'ath
##    to feature the multivariate regression tree as a possible model.
