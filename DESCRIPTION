Description: Performs multivariate regression tree calculations and
  multivariate partitioning. It features a previous version of function "rpart",
  called "rpartmv", that allows one to obtain a multivariate regression tree or
  a distance-based regression tree. These methods had been discarded from the
  current implementation of function rpart from package rpart.
