# R Package mvpart

Multivariate Regression Trees and Multivariate Partitioning

Performs multivariate regression tree calculations and multivariate
partitioning. It features a previous version of function rpart, called rpartmv,
that allows one to obtain a multivariate regression tree or a distance-based
regression tree. These methods had been discarded from the current
implementation of function rpart from package rpart.
